# CS50 Submissions 💻

What I built while surviving Harvard’s CS50.  
Good times, lots of code, and plenty of late-night bug hunts.

This repo includes my personal solutions to the problem sets and projects from **CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science**, covering topics like:

- C programming
- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory and pointers
- Python, SQL
- Web development with Flask

Each folder represents a week or a project from the course.
