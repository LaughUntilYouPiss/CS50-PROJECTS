1. The listener’s audio aura combines moderate energy, a slightly somber mood,
and strong danceability.

2. The calculated averages provide a general idea about the listener's audio aura.
However, they are not very representative of the listener, as certain songs might
have too low or too high values, which can distort the averages.Additionally, the
listener might also have different moods depending on the context in which the
songs are listened to. The averages might not capture this, potentially suggesting
a more uniform audio aura than what truly exists.
To better capture a listener's audio aura, we might consider grouping similar
songs together based on their features to reflect the listener's diverse
preferences and assign weight to frequently played tracks to highlight their
significance. Analyzing song lyrics to determine the mood could add valuable
context, and considering factors like time of day or activity could further
refine the understanding of mood and energy. By combining musical features,
lyrical content, and listening habits, we can create a more personalized
and accurate profile of the listener’s audio aura.
